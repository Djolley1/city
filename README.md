# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

 It's a simple city explorer application built using React, the application allows users to search for a city and retrieve its location information.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine, as it includes npm, which is necessary for managing dependencies and running scripts.
- Create a new React project using Create React App, which is a toolchain for setting up React projects with zero configuration.
- Change your current directory to the newly created project directory.
- Install any additional dependencies required for the application, such as Bootstrap or any other libraries used in the code.
- You need to obtain an access token from LocationIQ API. You can sign up for a free account on their website to get the access token.

## Architecture

- The application is built using React, which provides a component-based architecture for building interactive user interfaces.
- The primary language used for writing the application logic, including state management, API integration, and event handling.
- Bootstrap is used for styling the application. It provides pre-designed CSS components and utilities for creating responsive and visually appealing layouts.
- The application integrates with the LocationIQ API to fetch location information based on the city entered by the user.
